# As discussed in the README, this is really my fourth attempt at writing
# RSS parsing code. For the record, I thought I'd list the approaches I
# tried and abandoned. In a way, that's more interesting than the one I
# picked...
#
# First I used hashes for storage and just looked for matching tags.
# That approach works, kinda, but it doesn't really understand nested 
# elements at all. As a result, it becomes really hard to deal with Atom
# feeds, where an <email> element could belong to one of a number of kinds
# of person. Plus, I wanted a real object-based approach which would be
# amenable to RDoc documentation.
#
# Next I wrote a classic stack-based parser, with a container stack and a 
# text buffer stack. That worked well for RSS; I got it parsing every RSS
# variant, and even went as far as a test suite.  However, as I tried 
# extending it to deal with Atom, I realized that the parser code was 
# becoming hard to follow, as the state machine gained more and more 
# special cases.
#
# For a third iteration, I tried to generalize the knowledge represented by the
# state machine, by placing it in the context stack. That is, I would have a
# smart stack that knew which XML elements could go inside other elements.
# Actually, there would have been four context stacks, for containers,
# attributes, tags and textual data.
#
# That design never made it past the paper stage, because I realized that I
# could move all the knowledge into the classes used to create the objects of
# the final parse tree.  With the new model--the one used in this code--the
# parser really doesn't know anything about Atom or RSS. It just forwards
# events to a tree of objects, which construct child objects as appropriate to
# grow the tree and represent the feed.
